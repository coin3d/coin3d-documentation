The documentation captured in this repository is specifically for Coin3D 3.1.3 and any modifications made for the Magic Lantern projects.

This [Coin3D](https://github.com/coin3d/Coin3D) project is a copy of the Coin3D 3.1.3 library located at https://bitbucket.org/Coin3D. This documentation includes modifications to support the Wizzer Works Magic Lantern project, identified in the "magiclantern" branch. The "master" branch contains the original source distributed by Kongsberg Oil & Gas Technologies.

Documentation on the modifications for Magic Lantern can be found on the [Coin 3.1.3 Modifications wiki page](https://github.com/magic-lantern-studio/mle-documentation/wiki/Coin-3.1.3-Modifications).

## Coin3D v4.0
